            <strong>Nelson Mandela</strong> was a social rights activist, politician and philanthropist who became South
            Africaâ€™s first
            Black president from <em>1994 to 1999.</em> After becoming involved in the anti-apartheid movement in his
            20s,
            Mandela joined the African National Congress in 1942. For 20 years, he directed a campaign of peaceful,
            nonviolent defiance against the South African government and its racist policies.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Beginning in 1962</strong> , Mandela spent 27 years in prison for political offenses. In 1993,
            Mandela and South
            African President F.W. de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to dismantle
            the country's apartheid system. For generations to come, Mandela will be a source of inspiration for civil
            rights activists worldwide.

            When Mandela was 16, it was time for him to partake in the traditional African circumcision ritual to mark
            his entrance into manhood. The ceremony of circumcision was not just a surgical procedure, but an elaborate
            ritual in preparation for manhood.

            In African tradition, an uncircumcised man cannot inherit his father's wealth, marry or officiate at tribal
            rituals. Mandela participated in the ceremony with 25 other boys. He welcomed the opportunity to partake in
            his people's customs and felt ready to make the transition from boyhood to manhood.

            His mood shifted during the proceedings, however, when Chief Meligqili, the main speaker at the ceremony,
            spoke sadly of the young men, explaining that they were enslaved in their own country. Because their land
            was controlled by white men, they would never have the power to govern themselves, the chief said.

            He went on to lament that the promise of the young men would be squandered as they struggled to make a
            living and perform mindless chores for white men. Mandela would later say that while the chief's words
            didn't make total sense to him at the time, they would eventually formulate his resolve for an independent
            South Africa.
